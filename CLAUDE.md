# Spirit Media Template

> **CLAUDE.md belongs in version control — NEVER add it to .gitignore. This file is the shared source of truth for all developers and all Claude Code sessions.**

This site: Spirit Media Template | Repo: github.com/Spirit-Media-US/spirit-media-template | Domain: TBD | Sanity ID: TBD

**Migration protocol:** /home/deploy/bin/tools-api/pipelines/migration/CLAUDE.md

## Dev Commands

- `npm run dev` -- local preview
- `npm run build` -- production build to dist/

## Mandatory -- Before Starting Work
Always start Claude sessions from inside this directory:
```
cd /srv/sites/spirit-media-template && claude
```
Running Claude from ~/ or ~/Sites/ bypasses this project's CLAUDE.md. A pre-edit hook enforces this, but following the workflow prevents warnings and ensures all project rules are loaded.

Then run: `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`

## Stack

- Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS v4
- Sanity Studio (to be configured per new site)

## Purpose

This is the **template repo** used as the starting point for all new SMP client sites. It contains the standard Astro + Tailwind + Sanity scaffold with Lefthook hooks, Biome config, and .gitignore pre-configured.

When creating a new site, clone this template and customize the CLAUDE.md with the site-specific details (domain, Sanity ID, port, etc.).

## Status -- as of 2026-04-08

### Completed
- Astro 5 + Tailwind v4 scaffold
- Lefthook hooks (block-main-push, large-file blocker, secret scanner)
- Biome config
- Standard .gitignore (blocks media, .env, node_modules)
- Template CLAUDE.md ready for customization

### Still Pending
- None -- this is a template, not a live site

## Rules

- All work goes to the **dev** branch -- never push directly to main
- Only merge dev to main when Kevin says "push to main"
- Every site cloned from this template must have a customized CLAUDE.md
- public/_headers must include CSP and security headers
- 404 page should have noindex meta tag
<!--
100 Club commitments template — copy this block verbatim into a site's CLAUDE.md
during Phase 2H of the execute plan. Substitute spirit-media-template with the actual R2 path slug.
The guardrails script (/home/deploy/bin/100club-lint.sh) self-skips any site whose
CLAUDE.md lacks the heading "## 100 Club commitments", so installing this block
activates the pre-commit lint on the site.

## 100 Club commitments (locked — do not regress)

**100 Club bar = homepage, median-of-5. Inner pages are quality work, not gate criteria.**

Every commitment below is a LOAD-BEARING structural decision. Do not "re-add" any of them without understanding the consequences.

### Hero image(s) are R2-only, NOT Sanity
- **URL pattern**: `https://assets.spiritmediapublishing.com/spirit-media-template/hero-*.webp` (plus any other LCP images moved to R2 per this site's hero structure)
- **Why**: same origin as fonts (one TLS handshake), stable URL enables 103 Early Hints, hardcoded URL survives Sanity edits without rebuild
- **To change a hero**: upload a new WebP (matching sizes at matching quality) to the same R2 path. Any Sanity fields for the hero image have been removed from the schema — editors cannot change the hero via the CMS.

### CSS must stay wrapped in @layer base
- `Layout.astro`'s `<style is:inline>` wraps everything in `@layer base` except `@font-face` and `@keyframes`.
- **Why**: unlayered rules beat every `@layer` rule regardless of specificity. Tailwind v4 ships utilities in `@layer utilities`. If critical CSS is unlayered, `.grid-cols-1` overrides external `.lg:grid-cols-4` and grids collapse site-wide.

### ClientRouter is OFF
- No `<ClientRouter />`, no `import { ClientRouter }` in Layout.astro.
- **Why**: static marketing sites don't need SPA nav. Saves ~125ms forced reflow + ~100ms script eval on mobile.
- All page JS uses `DOMContentLoaded` with readyState guard.

### GA loads on first user interaction
- Events: scroll, mousemove, touchstart, keydown, click. 8s fallback timeout.
- **Why**: Lighthouse never interacts, so GA doesn't load in audits. Real users get GA after they engage (post-LCP).

### `<a>` elements on dark backgrounds MUST have an explicit default-state color class
- Base `a { color: var(--color-red|primary) }` rule in `global.css` otherwise applies → brand color on dark bg fails WCAG.
- Any new `<a href="tel:">`, `<a href="mailto:">`, or link in a dark section needs `text-stone-400` / `text-stone-100` / similar. `hover:text-*` doesn't protect the default state.

### `[data-animate]` transitions are transform-only, no opacity
- `global.css`: `transition: transform 0.65s cubic-bezier(...)`. **Do NOT add `opacity` back to the transition.**
- **Why**: Lighthouse captures frames mid-transition; a 0.65s opacity fade catches text at ~50% opacity → 40+ false color-contrast failures. Transform-only gives the same visual slide-in without the a11y artifact.
- If the site doesn't use `data-animate` at all, this commitment is preventive only.

### Early Hints, CSP, X-Robots-Tag in public/_headers
- `X-Robots-Tag: index, follow` overrides CF Pages' default `noindex` on `*.pages.dev`
- CSP allows CF Insights (`static.cloudflareinsights.com` in `script-src`, `cloudflareinsights.com` in `connect-src`) + all origins actually used by this site
- `Link:` headers for 2 critical fonts on `/*` + hero image on `/` → CF Pages promotes to HTTP/2 103 Early Hints

### Images: width/height attrs match urlFor dimensions
- Every below-fold `<img>` has both attrs. Any urlFor resize change must update the attrs in the same commit.
- `sizes` attribute = actual display width in px, NOT `100vw` (the latter forces over-delivery at DPR 2).

### Build pipeline
- `inlineStylesheets: 'auto'` (NOT `'always'`)
- `scripts/async-css.mjs` postbuild rewrites external CSS to `media="print" onload` swap (invoked from `package.json` build script)
- `scripts/100club-verify.mjs` post-build Playwright asserts grids + h-N images + console errors — blocks bad builds
- `/home/deploy/bin/100club-lint.sh` is wired into `lefthook.yml` pre-commit
- No `@playform/inline` / Beasties — incompatible with TW v4 utility-heavy markup
